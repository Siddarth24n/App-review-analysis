# App-review-analysis


This repository is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Play Store datasets, along with a Tableau visualization project.

The Play Store app data offers significant opportunities for app development businesses. By analyzing this data, developers can extract actionable insights to enhance their apps and better capture the Android market.

The dataset includes detailed information for each app, such as its category, rating, size, and more. Additionally, there is a separate dataset with customer reviews for these Android apps.

The Tableau project titled "EDA Play Store App Review" focuses on analyzing user reviews of apps available on the Google Play Store. It involves creating visualizations to gain insights into user opinions and sentiments. The results from the EDA and sentiment analysis are integrated into a comprehensive dashboard.

This dashboard provides a detailed overview of user reviews, sentiment trends, and other key metrics. It is designed to assist app developers and marketers by offering valuable insights into user feedback, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions to improve app performance and enhance user satisfaction.
